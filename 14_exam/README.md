## Practical tasks
1. **Primes.** Create a simplicity check calculator. Users should be able to input a number and click the button or press some key to get a result - if the number is prime or composite.
2. **Fibonacci.** Create a Fibonacci sequence calculator. User inputs a number n and application outputs all Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th member.
3. **Who is gonna win?** Create a random number generator. Users should be able to enter a number, let it be n, and calculator should output a random integer in the interval from 1 to n.
4. **Comics.** Create a web application where users can leaf over comics. Use REST API to get data, for example, `https://xkcd.com/{comic_id}/info.0.json`.
5. **Smile!** Create an emoji search web application analogous to https://ahfarmer.github.io/emoji-search/. Use data from this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search/master/src/emojiList.json.
6. **Back to school.** Create a web application that tests your knowledge of the multiplication table. The application asks a user to answer a question "how much is `n * m`", where `n` and `m` are randomly generated numbers between 1 and 9. After the user answers the question (inputs number and click a button), the application asks the next question. The application should also display a percentage of correct answers and the average time spent on each question.
