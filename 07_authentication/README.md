### Authentication and authorization

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6556522/authentication-versus-authorization

Authentication = login + password (who you are).
**Authentication** is the process of ascertaining that somebody really is who they claim to be.


Authorization = permissions (what you are allowed to do).
**Authorization** refers to rules that determine who is allowed to do what. E.g. Adam may be authorized to create and delete databases, while Usama is only authorised to read.
